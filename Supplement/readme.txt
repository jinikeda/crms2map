This file is developed for monthly data analysis. CRMS datasets should be stored in the "CRMS2Map/Input" folder by following the crms2map analysis procedures

1. Monthly_analysis_practice.py: Using a subset of data (e.g., Temperature, Salinity, and Water Levels), summarize the information by basin, sub-basin, and vegetation community.
2. Bootstrap_Regression_analysis.py: Machine learning for stepwise linear regression and random forest regression (prerequired data from Monthly_analysis_practice.py)
3. Regression_analysis_plot.py: Plot stepwise linear and random forest regression analyses (prerequired data from Monthly_analysis_practice.py and Bootstrap_Regression_analysis.py)
